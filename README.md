Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors project!

This project was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It features a simple and interactive user interface that allows you to play the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

To get started, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You will be presented with a screen that displays the game's rules and asks you to select your move.

To select your move, simply click on one of the three buttons labeled "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors." The computer will then randomly select its own move, and the results will be displayed on the screen.

The project uses DOM manipulation and event listeners to enable interactivity. Each button has an event listener attached to it that listens for a click event. When the user clicks on a button, the corresponding move is stored in a variable and used to determine the winner of the game.

I hope you enjoy playing my Rock Paper Scissors game! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for checking out my project!
